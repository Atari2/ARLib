# ARLib
A simple WIP C++20 implementation of standard containers and library features.

Note: the developer of this library is not responsible for any error caused by it. Everything is based on necessity as it is a personal project done mostly for fun. PR and issues are welcome but not guaranteed to be fixed/merged. Do so at your own discretion.
