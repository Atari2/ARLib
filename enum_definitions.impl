# this is a file used to generate enum definitions
# it generates bitfield enums by default
# format is "ClassName<>(UnderlyingType)[Members...]"
# the <> indicates wether the enum will receive implementations of bitwise operations
# if the <> is not there, it will, if it's there, it won't.
# underlying_type can be omitted and will be filled in by the generation script
# underlying_type can be from uint8_t, uint16_t, uint32_t, uint64_t
